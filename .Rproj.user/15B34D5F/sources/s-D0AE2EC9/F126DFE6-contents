## R Markdown Tutorial 
### **Still under construction**; mainly for me to learn R Markdown 


Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> or <https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf>.

This is the home [page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html#available-packages-P) of CRAN's instructions for its packages. To hyperlink a word, type the word in [] and then in brackets() paste the link.  

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 
R warning=false, message =false to get rid of warning  

# **How to create a new page on Git**
NB Make repository on github with the same name
1.	Create a folder/project in R studio  
2.  Create a R Markdown file and chose html when it comes up as well as install the necessary packages. Change the title as well as save as index.rmd ( I am not sure why to save it as index.rmd but that is what i was told)  
3.	Open git bash and set working directory n Git bash  
4.	Type: Git init  
5.	Type: Git add .  
6.	Type: Git commit -m”message”  
7.	Copy and paste the directions from git hub “command line push” separately  
8.	Push up to git hub by doing git remote add link and then git push link  
9.	Go to settings master branch save  
10.	Then click on the published website  

**Whenever I place double astericks around text it makes it bold**

##If I use two number signs I get a mini header versus one which provides a main header

##What are Code Chunks and how are they useful?

When I first started using R Markdown, the shortcut Ctrl + Alt + i (OS X: Cmd + Option + i) really helped.  For more on Code Chunks, here is a link to a R Markdown codechunk cheatsheet. 
<https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html>

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
 
```{r images, echo=FALSE}

"To add images type ![caption](directory/image.png"
```

 **To embed a video**
 I installed the vembedr package and pretty much followed these [instructions](https://github.com/ijlyttle/vembedr). 
The first video I tried the use_start_time function and set it at a part of the video that I find funny.  

```{r video, echo=FALSE}
("The one that worked for me was the '<iframe src=URL, width=420, height=315, frameborder=0, allowfullscreen,
 use_start_time(ms)> </iframe>' option with double quotations around each answer")
```
 
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBuZEGYXA6E" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen, 
#> use_start_time("1m25s")> </iframe>
