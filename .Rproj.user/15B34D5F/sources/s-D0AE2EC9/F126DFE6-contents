## R Markdown Tutorial 
### **Still under construction**; mainly for me to learn R

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# **How to create a new page on Git**
1.	Create a folder/project in R studio.
2.  Create a R Markdown file and chose html when it comes up as well as install the necessary packages. Change the title as well as save as index.rmd ( I am not sure why to save it as index.rmd but that is what i was told)
3.	Open git bash and set working directory n Git bash
4.	Type: Git init
5.	Type: Git add .
6.	Type: Git commit -m”message”
7.	Make repository on github with the same name
8.	Copy and paste the directions from git hub “command line push” separately 
9.	Push up to git hub by doing git remote add link and then git push link
10.	Go to settings master branch save
11.	Then click on the published website

**Whenever I pust double astericks around text it highlights it**

R warning=false, message =false to get rid of warning

##If I use two number signs I get a mini header versus one which provides a main header

#What are Code Chunks and how are they useful?

When I first started using R Markdown, the shortcust Ctrl + Alt + I (OS X: Cmd + Option + I) really helped.  For more on Code Chunks, here is a link to a R Markdown codechunk cheatsheet. 
<https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html>

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
